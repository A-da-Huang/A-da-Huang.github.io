    <p>I like to take photography pictures of everything with my camerma. It's a Sony Cyber-shot RX100 VII, which is a digital camera.
      I do want to upgrade to a DSLR camera in the future.

        <p>This summer I went to Austin, Texas to watch CS2's first USA tournament. The Tickets sold crazy fast.
          I had the chance of meeting with my online friends in real life. It was a very fun experience. Here is one out of many groups of friends I got to meet with.
          We did an escape room together.
