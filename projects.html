        <img src="images/project1.png" alt="Project One" class="project-image">
        <p>You are able to play soundboard sounds whenever you pressed a hotkey.</p>
        <p>I used alot of cut up images of the cat to make it's arm move whenever the button keys were pressed using JavaScript. I also took
          sound clips from a free website the professor provided us with. I learned how to use JavaScript to make the sounds play and pause
          whenever the keys were pressed.

        <h3>Sustainability Quiz Game</h3>
        <img src="images/project2.png" alt="Project Two" class="project-image">
        <p>I worked as a team to create a St.Thomas Sustainability quiz as a final project in OOP</p>
        <p>I created methods, classes and ensured the project ran smoothly in Java. I also created some images to make the quiz look prettier.

        <h3>Tsunami Model</h3>
        <img src="images/project3.png" alt="Project Three" class="project-image">
        <p>This was a mini scale model showing off how a tsunami was formed for elementary teachers to show students.</p>
        <p>I created the design of the model. Our team worked together using a plastic bin to hold the water, we also cut out a hole in the bin
          so that the water could drain out. The wave was created using a plastic plate, hot glued onto a tube that we would use to pull up and down
        to create the waves. We had a plastic ramp and a little landscape area where the wave crashed into simulated a tsunami. </p>
